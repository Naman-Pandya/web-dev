        <h2 id="a">Einstein</h2>
        <p>Imagination is more important than a person's memory. While the traditional education is keen on the latter, one must realize that
            memorization does not test a person's intelligence. Yet we find that people are in this trap . The educators do not see this either, but 
            true revolution can only come through education,real education wherein values of compassion are also taught.

        <h2 id="b">Gandhi</h2>
        <p> Forgiveness is not the attribute of the weak, only the strong can forgive. Whilst his goal was peace, Gandhi became the voice of the common man, he
            was the spark which brought about non-violence movement. His life was full of struggle but his contribution to freedom has not gone in vain. India 
            is thankful to him and other such freedom fighters.

        <h2 id="c">Osho</h2>
        <p> Life has not to be taken seriously , what we need the most right now is a little bit of laughter. There should be a dance in our soul and we should 
            make the most of our lives. We must remember our mortality , that we may end anytime, so of what use is this endless pursuit of wealth or power going 
            to be, don't waste away your time, live in joy , be alive for once !
